=== Upload a file to a feed through API
____
This scenario describes how to use the functionality of Feeds API to upload a file into a private _feed_ and retrieve the processed _file_ in a _search_.

*Prerequisites*: to follow this scenario, ensure that you have at least one _feed_ to which you can contribute (upload) your files.
This scenario is based on the result of the <<#Create-a-private-feed,Create a private feed>> scenario.

*Expected results*:

* A file is uploaded into the InfoNgen storage.
* The uploaded file is sent to a _feed_.
* After processing, it appears in a _search_.

*Related topics*: <<general/overview.adoc#feeds-api,Feeds API>>, <<general/overview.adoc#search-api,Search API>>.

==== 0. Check the feeds to which you can contribute

After creating a _feed_, you must make sure that you can send documents into it.
This is achieved by placing your own unique _user_ ID into the _feed_'s `"contributing_users"` array.

To check that you have _feeds_ where you are allowed to upload, run the `GET feeds/contributions` request.

----
curl -X GET {{API_link}}/feeds/contributions \
-H 'Authorization:Bearer {{access_token}}' \
-H 'x-api-key: {{API_key}}'
----

The Feeds API returns the following response:

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Total: 1
----

[source, json]
----
[
    {
        "feed_uid": "{your_feed_unique_ID}",
        "feed_name": "My private email feed"
    }
]
----

If the response returns zero _feeds_, create a _feed_ where you are a contributor.
See the the <<#Create-a-private-feed,Create a private feed>> scenario for reference.

[float]
==== 1. Create a link for file upload

Before you can upload a file into the InfoNgen storage, from where it will be processed, you must receive a link for file upload. To do that, run the `POST feeds/upload` request.

----
curl -X POST {{API_link}}/feeds/upload \
-H 'Authorization:Bearer {{access_token}}' \
-H 'x-api-key: {{API_key}}'
----

The Feeds API returns the following response with the `Location` header containing the necessary link:

----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://files.infongen.com/uploads/{client_id}/{company_id}/{user_id}/{link_properties}
----

This link is instrumental in the two following steps.
After uploading a file, you can download the uploaded document using this link.

[float]
==== 2. Send the file to the link

Use the received link to upload the file into the InfoNgen storage.
To do that, send the file as an attachment to a PUT request, where the address of the PUT request is the link from step 1.

*Requirements*:

* You must specify the `Content-Disposition` header in your PUT request for the file to be processed correctly, and the request must contain the `filename` parameter.
* This PUT request cannot carry any authorization.

In this request, we are uploading a .txt file named "2022 prognosis".

'''

----
curl --location --request PUT 'https://files.infongen.com/uploads/{client_id}/{company_id}/{user_id}/{link_properties}' \
--header 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="2022 prognosis.txt"' \
--form '=@"/C:/Users/{{user}}/Desktop/2022 prognosis.txt"'
----

The Feeds API returns the following response:

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
----

[float]
==== 3. Send the uploaded file into a feed

After uploading the file to the link, you must append this file from the InfoNgen storage to a _feed_ for processing and tagging.
To do that, run the `POST feeds/{{your_feed_unique_ID}}/content` request with the following parameters:

* `"title"` is a required property and will become the headline of the file you upload.
* `"author"` is an optional property and becomes the author of the uploaded file.
* `"date"` is an optional property and establishes the date and time of upload. +
When this field is accessed by Search API, it becomes `"published_at"` there.
* `"link"` contains the link from the API response in step 1.
* `"summary"` is an optional property that contains the summary of the uploaded document.
* `"image_uri"` is an optional property to add an image to the uploaded file.
* `"tags"` optional array contains the _tags_ that you can manually add to the uploaded document before its processing. +
Added _tags_ must be taken from the Reference API.

==== 4. Run a search for the uploaded file

To find the tagged file, run the `POST searches` request to create a _search_.
You can use the following parameters:

* `"conditions"` array must contain the conditions `"name": "main.job.code", "values": ["{your_feed_unique_ID}"]` object from the API response from step 3.
* `"search_settings"` object may control the clustering and date range settings. +
In this example, `"clustering": "URI"` and `"date_range": "Anytime"` ensure that the _search_ returns all results from the _feed_.
* `"show_options"` array contains the `["DOCUMENTS"]` value to immediately display the results.
